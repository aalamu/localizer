# Contributing to Localizer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Localizer**! We welcome contributions from developers and maintainers who are interested in improving this Java library and expanding its capabilities.

Localizer is designed to simplify internationalization (i18n) for Java applications, enabling easy support for multiple languages across APIs and applications.

## How to Contribute

We encourage developers to fork the repository, submit issues, and create pull requests. Below are a few guidelines to help you get started with contributing.

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, issues, or have suggestions, please open an issue by providing detailed steps to reproduce the problem. Be sure to include the version of Localizer you're using, your Java version, and any relevant configuration.

### 2. Submitting Code

- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies using Maven or Gradle.
- Run the tests and ensure everything is working before submitting your pull request.
- Make sure your code adheres to the project's coding standards, and ensure it is properly tested.


### 3. Branch Naming
   When creating a branch, please use one of the following conventions for clarity:

feature/: For adding new features (e.g., feature/add-localization-for-xyz).
bugfix/: For fixing bugs (e.g., bugfix/fix-missing-message-key).
chore/: For routine tasks and maintenance (e.g., chore/update-dependencies).
refactor/: For refactoring code without changing behavior (e.g., refactor/optimize-message-loading).

### 4. Writing Tests

We believe in strong test coverage. Before submitting a pull request, ensure your changes are covered by unit tests. We encourage using JUnit and Mockito to write your tests.

### 5. Code Reviews

All pull requests are subject to a code review. Please be patient while our maintainers review your changes. Constructive feedback will be provided, and we appreciate your willingness to collaborate.
